                        <p>Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are characterized by periods of extreme warming of local to
                            basin-scale marine habitat. Effects of MHWs on some seabirds (e.g. mass die-offs) are
                            well documented, but mechanisms by which seabirds respond to MHWs remain poorly
                            understood. Following from a symposium at the 3rd World Seabird Conference, this Theme
                            Section presents recent research to address this knowledge gap. Studies included here
                            spanned one or more MHW event, at spatial scales from individual seabird colonies to
                            large marine ecosystems in subtropical, temperate, and polar oceans, and over timespans
                            from months to decades. The findings indicate that MHWs can affect seabirds directly by
                            creating physiological heat stress that affects behavior or survival, or indirectly by
                            disrupting seabird food webs. Most seabird species have experienced limited effects from
                            MHWs to date, owing to ecological and behavioral adaptations that buffer MHW effects.
                            However, the intensity and frequency of MHWs is increasing due to global warming, and
                            more seabird species may have difficulty coping with future heatwave events.</p>

                        <p>For millennia, Inuit peoples of the Arctic and Subarctic have been challenged by the
                            impacts of climate change on the abundance of key subsistence species. Responses to
                            climate-induced declines in animal populations included switching to alternative food
                            sources and/or migrating to regions of greater availability. We examine these dynamics
                            for the Chugach Inuit (Sugpiat) people of southern coastal Alaska by synthesizing a
                            large body of evidence from archeological sites, including radiocarbon dates and
                            archaeofaunal assemblages, and by applying contemporary knowledge of glaciomarine
                            ecosystems, spatial patterns of resource richness, and ocean-climate induced regime
                            shifts in the Gulf of Alaska. We hypothesize that Chugach groups migrated from Cook
                            Inlet and Prince William Sound to the Kenai Peninsula during periods of low sea surface
                            temperatures (SSTs) to harvest harbor seals, which were seasonally aggregated near
                            tidewater glaciers during pupping season, as well as piscivorous seabirds, Pacific cod,
                            and other species that thrive under cool ocean conditions. During warming phases, the
                            Chugach returned to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound to fish for salmon and other
                            species that abound during higher SSTs. Drivers of this coupled human-natural system of
                            repeated (pulse) migration include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the dominant
                            pattern of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific that has been shown to generate
                            step-like regime shifts in the marine food web; and coastal glaciers that structure the
                            functioning of fiord ecosystems and support high levels of biological productivity. The
                            culturally-constructed Chugach niche in the glaciomarine habitat of the Gulf of Alaska
                            was based on intergenerationally transmitted ecological knowledge that enabled a
                            resilient, mobile response to climate and resource variation.</p>

                        <p> Seabirds are abundant, conspicuous members of marine ecosystems worldwide. Synthesis of
                            distribution data compiled over time is required to address regional management issues
                            and understand ecosystem change. Major challenges when estimating seabird densities at
                            sea arise from variability in dispersion of the birds, sampling effort over time and
                            space, and differences in bird detection rates associated with survey vessel type. Using
                            a novel approach for modeling seabirds at sea, we applied joint dynamic species
                            distribution models (JDSDM) with a vector-autoregressive spatiotemporal framework to
                            survey data collected over nearly five decades and archived in the North Pacific Pelagic
                            Seabird Database. We produced monthly gridded density predictions and abundance
                            estimates for 8 species groups (77% of all birds observed) within Cook Inlet, Alaska.
                            JDSDMs included habitat covariates to inform density predictions in unsampled areas and
                            accounted for changes in observed densities due to differing survey methods and
                            decadal-scale variation in ocean conditions. The best fit model provided a high level of
                            explanatory power (86% of deviance explained). Abundance estimates were reasonably
                            precise, and consistent with limited historical studies. Modeled densities identified
                            seasonal variability in abundance with peak numbers of all species groups in July or
                            August. Seabirds were largely absent from the study region in either fall (e.g.,

                        <p>Some of the longest and most comprehensive marine ecosystem monitoring programs were
                            established in the Gulf of Alaska following the environmental disaster of the Exxon
                            Valdez
                            oil spill over 30 years ago. These monitoring programs have been successful in assessing
                            recovery from oil spill impacts, and their continuation decades later has now provided
                            an
                            unparalleled assessment of ecosystem responses to another newly emerging global threat,
                            marine heatwaves. The 2014–2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) in the Gulf of
                            Alaska was the longest lasting heatwave globally over the past decade, with some
                            cooling,
                            but also continued warm conditions through 2019. Our analysis of 187 time series from
                            primary production to commercial fisheries and nearshore intertidal to offshore oceanic
                            domains demonstrate abrupt changes across trophic levels, with many responses persisting
                            up
                            to at least 5 years after the onset of the heatwave. Furthermore, our suite of metrics
                            showed novel community-level groupings relative to at least a decade prior to the
                            heatwave.
                            Given anticipated increases in marine heatwaves under current climate projections, it
                            remains uncertain when or if the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH
                            state.

                        <p> Pacific sand lance Ammodytes personatus are a key forage fish in the North Pacific
                            for many species of salmon, groundfish, seabirds, and marine mammals and have historically been
                            important to predators in relatively warm years. However, extreme declines in the nutritional
                            value of sand lance in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, during 2012−2016 indicate that energy
                            transfer from lower trophic levels to predators via sand lance may have been disrupted during the
                            North Pacific marine heatwave in 2015 and 2016. Nutritional value (length, energy density, and
                            whole-body energy) was measured in age-0 and age-1 sand lance collected during July in cool
                            (2012−2013) and increasingly warm (2014−2016) years. The value of age-0 fish was relatively stable, with only minor differences among years for length and whole-body energy. By contrast, the
                            value of age-1 fish significantly declined in 2015, and by 2016 they were 38% shorter and 13%
                            lower in energy density compared to cooler years. This contributed to significant declines in
                            whole-body energy of 44% in 2015 and 89% in 2016 compared to cooler years (2012−2014). The
                            2015 sand lance cohort experienced little growth or lipid accumulation from July 2015 at age-0 to
                            July 2016 at age-1. This effective disruption of energy flow through pelagic food webs probably
                            contributed to population declines and/or breeding failures observed among several predators in
                            the Gulf of Alaska and suggests that tipping points were reached during the heatwave.</p>

                            potential for such competition, but these assessments are often hampered by data

                        <p>To better understand the influence of glacier runoff on fjord ecosystems, we sampled

                            fjords
                            in coastal areas of the Gulf Alaska. We used generalized additive models and
                            geostatistics
                            to identify the range of glacier runoff influence into coastal waters within fjords of
                            varying estuarine influence and topographic complexity. We also modeled the response of
                            depth-integrated chlorophyll <em>a</em> concentration, copepod biomass, fish and seabird
                            abundance to physical, nutrient and biotic predictor variables. The effects of glacial
                            runoff were traced at least 10 km into coastal fjords by cold, turbid, stratified and
                            generally nutrient-rich near-surface conditions. Glacially modified physical gradients,
                            nutrient availability and among-fjord differences explained 67% of the variation in
                            phytoplankton abundance, which is a driver of ecosystem structure at higher trophic
                            levels.
                            Copepod, euphausiid, fish and seabird distribution and abundance were related to
                            environmental gradients that could be traced to glacial freshwater input, particularly
                            turbidity and temperature. Seabird density was predicted by prey availability and
                            silicate
                            concentrations, which may be a proxy for upwelling areas where this nutrient is in
                            excess.
                            Similarities in ecosystem structure among fjords were attributable to an influx of cold,
                            fresh and sediment-laden water, whereas differences were likely related to fjord
                            topography
                            and local differences in estuarine vs. ocean influence. We anticipate that continued
                            changes
                            in the timing and volume of glacial runoff will ultimately alter coastal ecosystems in

                        <p>Pacific capelin (Mallotus villosus) populations declined dramatically in the Northeastern
                            Pacific following ocean warming after the regime shift of 1977, but little is known

                            environment. We assessed the distribution and abundance of spawning, non-spawning adult
                            and larval capelin in Glacier Bay, an estuarine fjord system in southeastern Alaska. We
                            used principal components analysis to analyze midwater trawl and beach seine data
                            collected between 1999 and 2004 with respect to oceanographic data and other measures of
                            physical habitat including proximity to tidewater glaciers and potential spawning
                            habitat. Both spawning and non-spawning adult Pacific capelin were more likely to occur
                            in areas closest to tidewater glaciers, and those areas were distinguished by lower
                            temperature, higher turbidity, higher dissolved oxygen and lower chlorophyll a levels
                            when compared with other areas of the bay. The distribution of larval Pacific capelin
                            was not sensitive to glacial influence. Pre-spawning females collected farther from
                            tidewater glaciers were at a lower maturity state than those sampled closer to tidewater
                            glaciers, and the geographic variation in the onset of spawning is likely the result of
                            differences in the marine habitat among sub-areas of Glacier Bay. Proximity to cold
                            water in Glacier Bay may have provided a refuge for capelin during the recent warm years
                            in the Gulf of Alaska.</p>
