                                fish species in the Gulf of Alaska were simultaneously reduced throughout the system.
                                Capelin (Mallotus catervarius), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and herring (Clupea
                                pallasii) populations were at historically low levels, and within this community abrupt
                                declines in portfolio effects identify trophic instability at the onset of the heatwave.
                                Although compensatory changes in age structure, size, growth or energy content of forage
                                fish were observed to varying degrees among all these forage fish, none were able to
                                fully
                                mitigate adverse impacts of the heatwave, which likely included both top-down and
                                bottom-up
                                forcing. Notably, changes to the demographic structure of forage fish suggested
                                size-selective removals typical of top-down regulation. At the same time, changes in
                                zooplankton communities may have driven bottom-up regulation as copepod community
                                structure
                                shifted toward smaller, warm water species, and euphausiid biomass was reduced owing to
                                the
                                loss of cold-water species. Mediated by these impacts on the forage fish community, an
                                unprecedented disruption of the normal pelagic food web was signaled by higher trophic
                                level
                                disruptions during 2015–2016, when seabirds, marine mammals, and groundfish experienced
                                shifts in distribution, mass mortalities, and reproductive failures. Unlike
                                decadal-scale
                                variability underlying ecosystem regime shifts, the heatwave appeared to temporarily
                                overwhelm the ability of the forage fish community to buffer against changes imposed by
                                warm
                                water anomalies, thereby eliminating any ecological advantages that may have accrued
                                from
                                having a suite of coexisting forage species with differing life-history compensations.

                                marine heatwaves. The 2014–2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) in the Gulf of
                                Alaska was the longest lasting heatwave globally over the past decade, with some
                                cooling,
                                but also continued warm conditions through 2019. Our analysis of 187 time series from
                                primary production to commercial fisheries and nearshore intertidal to offshore oceanic
                                domains demonstrate abrupt changes across trophic levels, with many responses persisting
                                up
                                to at least 5 years after the onset of the heatwave. Furthermore, our suite of metrics
                                showed novel community-level groupings relative to at least a decade prior to the
                                heatwave.
                                Given anticipated increases in marine heatwaves under current climate projections, it
                                remains uncertain when or if the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH

                                forage
                                fish species in the Gulf of Alaska were simultaneously reduced throughout the system.
                                Capelin (Mallotus catervarius), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and herring (Clupea
                                pallasii) populations were at historically low levels, and within this community abrupt
                                declines in portfolio effects identify trophic instability at the onset of the heatwave.
                                Although compensatory changes in age structure, size, growth or energy content of forage
                                fish were observed to varying degrees among all these forage fish, none were able to
                                fully
                                mitigate adverse impacts of the heatwave, which likely included both top-down and
                                bottom-up
                                forcing. Notably, changes to the demographic structure of forage fish suggested
                                size-selective removals typical of top-down regulation. At the same time, changes in
                                zooplankton communities may have driven bottom-up regulation as copepod community
                                structure
                                shifted toward smaller, warm water species, and euphausiid biomass was reduced owing to
                                the
                                loss of cold-water species. Mediated by these impacts on the forage fish community, an
                                unprecedented disruption of the normal pelagic food web was signaled by higher trophic
                                level
                                disruptions during 2015–2016, when seabirds, marine mammals, and groundfish experienced
                                shifts in distribution, mass mortalities, and reproductive failures. Unlike
                                decadal-scale
                                variability underlying ecosystem regime shifts, the heatwave appeared to temporarily
                                overwhelm the ability of the forage fish community to buffer against changes imposed by
                                warm
                                water anomalies, thereby eliminating any ecological advantages that may have accrued
                                from
                                having a suite of coexisting forage species with differing life-history compensations.

                                concern. Effective ecosystem-based fisheries management requires robust assessments of

                                potential for such competition, but these assessments are often hampered by data

                                and methodological challenges. This paper reviews current approaches and proposes best
                                practices for assessing forage fish fisheries–seabird resource competition. We highlight

                                data requirements, including spatially and temporally explicit data on fishery removals,

                                for integrated modeling approaches that can account for uncertainty and explore the

                                populations. Adopting these best practices can lead to more reliable assessments of

                            <p>To better understand the influence of glacier runoff on fjord ecosystems, we sampled
                                oceanographic conditions, nutrients, zooplankton, forage fish and seabirds within 4
                                fjords
                                in coastal areas of the Gulf Alaska. We used generalized additive models and
                                geostatistics
                                to identify the range of glacier runoff influence into coastal waters within fjords of
                                varying estuarine influence and topographic complexity. We also modeled the response of
                                depth-integrated chlorophyll <em>a</em> concentration, copepod biomass, fish and seabird
                                abundance to physical, nutrient and biotic predictor variables. The effects of glacial
                                runoff were traced at least 10 km into coastal fjords by cold, turbid, stratified and
                                generally nutrient-rich near-surface conditions. Glacially modified physical gradients,
                                nutrient availability and among-fjord differences explained 67% of the variation in
                                phytoplankton abundance, which is a driver of ecosystem structure at higher trophic
                                levels.
                                Copepod, euphausiid, fish and seabird distribution and abundance were related to
                                environmental gradients that could be traced to glacial freshwater input, particularly
                                turbidity and temperature. Seabird density was predicted by prey availability and
                                silicate
                                concentrations, which may be a proxy for upwelling areas where this nutrient is in
                                excess.
                                Similarities in ecosystem structure among fjords were attributable to an influx of cold,
                                fresh and sediment-laden water, whereas differences were likely related to fjord
                                topography
                                and local differences in estuarine vs. ocean influence. We anticipate that continued
                                changes
                                in the timing and volume of glacial runoff will ultimately alter coastal ecosystems in
                                the
                                future.</p>
