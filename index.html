            <p>Ocean Bight is a marine ecological consulting practice specializing in research on marine food webs,
                glacial fjord ecosystems, and integrated wildlife monitoring and assessments.</p>
            <p><em>Recent human-driven warming of the atmosphere, oceans, and land is affecting every region of the
                    globe. In Alaska's subarctic and Arctic oceans, we are already experiencing warmer ocean
                    temperatures,
                    increased freshwater runoff, significant glacier and sea ice loss, and extreme marine heatwaves.
                    These changes impact fish and wildlife populations that support Alaska's economy across many sectors
                    including
                    recreation, tourism, and commercial fisheries. </em></p>
            <p>Ocean Bight offers research and consulting services to address these challenges through data collection,
                citizen science, and public engagement to raise climate awareness. This website provides a platform to
                share compelling science stories, data visualizations, and invites public participation. </p>

                    <h3>Climate Data Stories</h3>
                    <p><strong>Climate Data Stories</strong> transform publicly available climate datasets into visual
                        narratives that connect the science to our everyday lives. By framing global trends through a
                        compelling personal lens, these stories aim to make the impacts of climate change tangible and
                        relatable for a broader audience.</p>
                    <p class="project-subheading"><strong>A Record of Warming Across Generations</strong></p>
                    <p> For more than a century, land and sea surface temperatures have shifted from cooler-than-average
                        conditions (blue) to record warmth (red), with each successive generation experiencing less of
                        the cool past and more warming in a rapidly changing climate.</p>
                    <img src="images/generations_GISSTEMP.png" alt="generations climate graph" class="project-example">
                    <p class="figure-caption"> The figure above shows the change in average Northen Hemisphere land and
                        sea temperatures experienced by four generations in my family, with each vertical bar
                        representing one year and colors showing change from a mid-20th-century baseline (blue = cooler,
                        red = warmer). From my grandmother's cool childhood temperatures to my nephew's record-warm land
                        and ocean surface temperatures, the climate we experience during our lifetime shapes how we
                        understand the world.</p>
                        <p class="project-subheading"><strong>Glacier Ice: Going Going Gone</strong></p>
                <p>Melting glaciers are among the most visible signs of a warming planet. As ice retreats, meltwater adds to global sea-level rise, and ice calving events signal rapid, ongoing change. Across coastal Alaska, tidewater glaciers are thinning, retreating, and disappearing at unprecedented rates as the climate warms.</p>

                <p class="figure-caption">Columbia Glacier in Prince William Sound, Alaska has been retreating rapidly for decades. Since the 1980's this tidewater glacier has lost more than half of it's thickness and volume. These images show the changes that have occurred in ice thickness and extent between July 2013 (top) and September 2019 (bottom), which spanned the period before and after unprecedented marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Alaska.

                    <h3>Seabirds as First Responders</h3>
                    <p>A marine heatwave of unprecedented intensity, duration, and spatial scale occurred in the North
                        Pacific during 2014-2016 and led to the largest seabird die-off ever recorded. We later learned
                        that seabirds were just the tip of the iceberg. The Pacific marine heatwave (AKA "the Blob")
                        was associated with catastrophic disruptions of marine food webs that impacted seabird,
                        humpback whale, and commercial fish populations in the Gulf of Alaska.</p>
                    <img src="images/MHW.png" alt="Marine heatwave impacts graphic" class="project-example">
                    <p class="figure-caption">The multiyear marine heatwave known as "the Blob" caused widespread
                        ecological impacts in the North Pacific Ocean. Four million Common Murres are missing from their
                        breeding colonies in Alaska, making this the single largest documented wildlife mortality event
                        in the modern era. Impacts to marine predators were widespread and coincided with forage fish
                        population collapse and other changes lower in the food chain. Harmful algal blooms and
                        metabolic effects of warming ocean temperatures provided a window into the ecosystem impacts of
                        extreme warming events.</p>
