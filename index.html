            <p><em>Recent human-driven warming of the atmosphere, oceans, and land is impacting every region
                    globally. In Alaska's subarctic and Arctic oceans, we are already experiencing warmer ocean
                    temperatures,
                    increased freshwater runoff, major glacier and sea ice loss, and extreme marine heatwaves. These
                    changes will have significant effects on fish and wildlife, which are important to Alaska's
                    economy through recreation, tourism, and commercial fisheries. </em></p>

                            <p>Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are characterized by periods of extreme warming of local to
                                basin-scale marine habitat. Effects of MHWs on some seabirds (e.g. mass die-offs) are
                                well documented, but mechanisms by which seabirds respond to MHWs remain poorly
                                understood. Following from a symposium at the 3rd World Seabird Conference, this Theme
                                Section presents recent research to address this knowledge gap. Studies included here
                                spanned one or more MHW event, at spatial scales from individual seabird colonies to
                                large marine ecosystems in subtropical, temperate, and polar oceans, and over timespans
                                from months to decades. The findings indicate that MHWs can affect seabirds directly by
                                creating physiological heat stress that affects behavior or survival, or indirectly by
                                disrupting seabird food webs. Most seabird species have experienced limited effects from
                                MHWs to date, owing to ecological and behavioral adaptations that buffer MHW effects.
                                However, the intensity and frequency of MHWs is increasing due to global warming, and
                                more seabird species may have difficulty coping with future heatwave events.</p>

                            <p>For millennia, Inuit peoples of the Arctic and Subarctic have been challenged by the
                                impacts of climate change on the abundance of key subsistence species. Responses to
                                climate-induced declines in animal populations included switching to alternative food
                                sources and/or migrating to regions of greater availability. We examine these dynamics
                                for the Chugach Inuit (Sugpiat) people of southern coastal Alaska by synthesizing a
                                large body of evidence from archeological sites, including radiocarbon dates and
                                archaeofaunal assemblages, and by applying contemporary knowledge of glaciomarine
                                ecosystems, spatial patterns of resource richness, and ocean-climate induced regime
                                shifts in the Gulf of Alaska. We hypothesize that Chugach groups migrated from Cook
                                Inlet and Prince William Sound to the Kenai Peninsula during periods of low sea surface
                                temperatures (SSTs) to harvest harbor seals, which were seasonally aggregated near
                                tidewater glaciers during pupping season, as well as piscivorous seabirds, Pacific cod,
                                and other species that thrive under cool ocean conditions. During warming phases, the
                                Chugach returned to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound to fish for salmon and other
                                species that abound during higher SSTs. Drivers of this coupled human-natural system of
                                repeated (pulse) migration include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the dominant
                                pattern of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific that has been shown to generate
                                step-like regime shifts in the marine food web; and coastal glaciers that structure the
                                functioning of fiord ecosystems and support high levels of biological productivity. The
                                culturally-constructed Chugach niche in the glaciomarine habitat of the Gulf of Alaska
                                was based on intergenerationally transmitted ecological knowledge that enabled a
                                resilient, mobile response to climate and resource variation.</p>

                                marine heatwaves. The 2014–2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) in the Gulf of
                                Alaska was the longest lasting heatwave globally over the past decade, with some
                                cooling,
                                but also continued warm conditions through 2019. Our analysis of 187 time series from
                                primary production to commercial fisheries and nearshore intertidal to offshore oceanic
                                domains demonstrate abrupt changes across trophic levels, with many responses persisting
                                up
                                to at least 5 years after the onset of the heatwave. Furthermore, our suite of metrics
                                showed novel community-level groupings relative to at least a decade prior to the
                                heatwave.
                                Given anticipated increases in marine heatwaves under current climate projections, it
                                remains uncertain when or if the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH

                            <p>To better understand the influence of glacier runoff on fjord ecosystems, we sampled
                                oceanographic conditions, nutrients, zooplankton, forage fish and seabirds within 4
                                fjords
                                in coastal areas of the Gulf Alaska. We used generalized additive models and
                                geostatistics
                                to identify the range of glacier runoff influence into coastal waters within fjords of
                                varying estuarine influence and topographic complexity. We also modeled the response of
                                depth-integrated chlorophyll <em>a</em> concentration, copepod biomass, fish and seabird
                                abundance to physical, nutrient and biotic predictor variables. The effects of glacial
                                runoff were traced at least 10 km into coastal fjords by cold, turbid, stratified and
                                generally nutrient-rich near-surface conditions. Glacially modified physical gradients,
                                nutrient availability and among-fjord differences explained 67% of the variation in
                                phytoplankton abundance, which is a driver of ecosystem structure at higher trophic
                                levels.
                                Copepod, euphausiid, fish and seabird distribution and abundance were related to
                                environmental gradients that could be traced to glacial freshwater input, particularly
                                turbidity and temperature. Seabird density was predicted by prey availability and
                                silicate
                                concentrations, which may be a proxy for upwelling areas where this nutrient is in
                                excess.
                                Similarities in ecosystem structure among fjords were attributable to an influx of cold,
                                fresh and sediment-laden water, whereas differences were likely related to fjord

                                and local differences in estuarine vs. ocean influence. We anticipate that continued
                                changes
                                in the timing and volume of glacial runoff will ultimately alter coastal ecosystems in

                                temperature, higher turbidity, higher dissolved oxygen and lower chlorophyll a levels
                                when compared with other areas of the bay. The distribution of larval Pacific capelin
                                was not sensitive to glacial influence. Pre-spawning females collected farther from
                                tidewater glaciers were at a lower maturity state than those sampled closer to tidewater
                                glaciers, and the geographic variation in the onset of spawning is likely the result of
                                differences in the marine habitat among sub-areas of Glacier Bay. Proximity to cold
                                water in Glacier Bay may have provided a refuge for capelin during the recent warm years
                                in the Gulf of Alaska.</p>
